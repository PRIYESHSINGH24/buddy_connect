## 🎮 Interactive Demo Scenarios

If judges ask questions, here are talking points:

### "How does it handle incorrect data?"
"The AI validates inputs before processing. If profile data is incomplete, it makes inferences based on available information and clearly communicates assumptions."

### "What about privacy concerns?"
"User data is only sent to Gemini for analysis when they request recommendations. We don't store conversations or profile data externally. Everything is processed securely."

### "How accurate are the recommendations?"
"Gemini Pro is trained on diverse data sources including GitHub, Stack Overflow, and professional networks. While no AI is 100% accurate, it provides valuable starting points that users can validate."

### "Could this replace human career coaches?"
"This is designed to supplement, not replace, human mentorship. It provides 24/7 initial guidance while human mentors provide deeper personalized coaching."

### "How is this better than ChatGPT?"
"We're using Gemini Pro integrated specifically into the career platform context. It understands the user's profile, their connections, and Buddy Connect's ecosystem—providing targeted rather than generic advice."
